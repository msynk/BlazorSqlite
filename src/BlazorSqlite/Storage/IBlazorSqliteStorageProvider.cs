/// This contract is public and semver-stable from 1.0, and the core consumes nothing else: adding a
/// backend requires no change to BlazorSqlite itself. Every implementation, first- or third-party,

/// <see cref="Capabilities"/> trustworthy.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Implementations are resolved from dependency injection and are expected to be safe to share, since
/// one provider instance serves every connection to every database it holds.
