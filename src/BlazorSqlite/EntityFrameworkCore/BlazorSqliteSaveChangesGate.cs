/// The connection raises <c>TablesChanged</c> as soon as the transport has run the write, which is
/// before EF has consumed the insert result and before it has accepted the tracked changes. On the
/// browser main thread that ordering is harmless: the refresh is queued behind the rest of the save.
/// On a thread-pool host - the in-process transport in a test, or Blazor Server - the refresh runs
/// on another thread, and re-executing the query materialises the just-inserted row into a change
/// tracker that is still assigning it its store-generated key. That surfaced as
/// "another instance with the same key value is already being tracked" thrown out of the
/// <em>write</em>. Waiting for <see cref="DbContext.SavedChanges"/> makes the read follow the write
/// on every host.
